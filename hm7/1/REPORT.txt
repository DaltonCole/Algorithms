The average run time in for Kruskal's algorithm was: 0.009912227630615235 seconds
The average run time in for Prim's algorithm was 0.009767668008804322 seconds

Kruskal's algorithm took approximately 1.01479980909 times longer than Prim's, which is a neglectable difference.
This implies that both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are equally as efficient for finding a Minimal Spanning Tree.
